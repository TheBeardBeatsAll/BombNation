Recreation of the game BomberMan with 3 player classes each with
their own special ability, activated by pressing e, with a 10 sec cooldown.

The player can exit to main menu at any stage by pressing g.
Players can pick up power ups to increase amount of bombs placed at any time,
increase their score and increase explosion size.
3 levels with 3 types of enemies to destroy and increase your score by doing so.
Players progress by finding the portal an walking through it.
Enemies and bombs will kill the player resetting bomb count and power and position.
Main menu navigated using w, s and ENTER with class selection navigated using 
a, d and ENTER to begin the game.
Bombs explode after 3 seconds and destroy all blocks around them until and any players
or enemies that get caught in the explosion.

The parts of this I am proudest off are all the mechanics behind the game ie movement and the bombs.
